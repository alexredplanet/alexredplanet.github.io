**Ex-Founder with experience across data science, molecular biology, research, strategy, and product development.**

I'm deeply passionate about leveraging technological advances to create products that benefit society. I care about the human experience: health, education, our relationships with each other, and our relationship to the environment. I'm interested in how these areas can be improved through technology, and I like the process of employing data science and AI to achieve this. 

I'm also passionate about business, innovation, and entrepreneurship. I've founded one company, and been on the founding team of two others so far. I've always been interested in a wide range of topics, and have been fortunate enough so far in my career to satiate this interest by taking on a variety of roles across biotechnology, data science, machine learning, and entrepreneurship. See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-daniel-mars/) for more details on my education and experience.

One of the most important things in my life is objective truth, and that is what drove me into data science. To me, being a data scientist is a never ending pursuit of truth, an endless desire to make sense of the world, and to make the best decision possible with the information available.

I'm always willing to chat and exchange ideas, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect.
